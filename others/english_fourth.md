# Talk about whether there is a divide between sciences and humanities。
+  Hello everyone，the topic of my speech is that there is no divide between sciences and humanities.
+ - First of all, there is no obvious boundary between sciences and humanities in history. Many philosophers have a deep understanding of science, and many scientists is good at humanities.
+ - Secondly, science and humanitis are one thing. Science is to explore the mystery of the whole world , while humanities are to explore the mystery of history and the human mind. They are both an act of exploration, and the two should not be separated.
+ - Lastly,the most important thing is that science and humanities can promote each other. A successful scientist often has some understanding in the field of humanistic knowledge, and can absorb nutrient from it and use it in his own scientific research.
+  All in all, science and humanities are an inseparable whole. Although they seem to be quite different on the surface, they are essentially closely related. So I think there is no divide between science and humanities.
## Thank you.
