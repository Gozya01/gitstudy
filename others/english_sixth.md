# Talk about students' dishonest practices and the meatures to take to cultivate students' virtue of honesty.
+ Hello everyoneï¼Œthe topic of my speech is talking about the dishonest of students.
+ - The dishonest practices of students mainly include cheating in exams, cheating in completing homework and plagiarizing in writing papers. These are very common situations in many colleges and universities. This not only represents the lack of integrity of some students, but also shows that there are problems in the way that schools and society cultivate students' quality.
+ - So, how should we cultivate the quality of students? First of all, teachers must give full play to the role of precepts and deeds to infiltrate students' sense of integrity. Secondly, teachers should use  festivals and activities to carefully plan and organize Young Pioneers activities, vigorously publicize and promote the sense of integrity. Finally, the society should increase the cultivation of honesty.
+ All in all, honest is  very important  in our lives.We all
should try our best to behave honestly and make
the people around us to be honest.
