#  the abilities that all engineering students should have
## before
I'm glad to be here.The point I'm trying to make is that  the abilities that all engineering students should have.
## ability to think independently
First of all,in my opinion,the ability to think independently is necessary.
- You need to keep thinking about what you really want  as you explore.Otherwise,One day you will be replaced by a machine.
## The ability to face mistakes and correct them
Secondly,as far as I'm concerned,we also master the ability to face mistakes and correct them.
- In college,we maybe  face all kinds of errors.What's more,we have the chance to correct them.
- Unlike in college,when we work,we can't make mistakes.In other words,the cost is very high.
- Thus,everyone should have the ability to face mistakes and correct them.
## programming ability
Last but not least,what I'm going to talk about is the programming ability.
- It is universally acknowledged that With the rapid development of information society, computer plays a more and more important role in society.
- No matter what your engineering major is,you have to deal with the computer.
- By mastering basic programming ability,you could work more efficiently.
## End
That's all.Thank you.
