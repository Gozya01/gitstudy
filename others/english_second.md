I'm glad to be here.The point I'm trying to make is that kids are born scientists.
Carl Sagan said, 
> “Every kid starts out as a natural-born scientist, and then we 
beat it out of them.” 
- That's exactly what I'm thinking about.I couldn't agree more.
## first topic 
- Kids are born scientists. They’re always turning over rocks and playing tricks. They’re always doing things that by and large are destructive.
- That’s what exploration kind of is. If you take stuff apart, whether or not you know how to put it back together. This is what kids do.
- An adult scientist is a kid who never grew up. That’s what an adult scientist does.
- The president of Harvard once said, if you think education is expensive, you should try the cost of ignorance.
- So, we don’t have enough parents who understand or know how to value the inquisitive nature of their own kids .
## Second topic
- People say, what can I do to get my kids interested in science. They’re already interested in science. You’re the one who’s the problem.
- In fact, children have an innate interest in science.
- However,The role of adults in this process is far greater than that of children.
- They vote.They have opportunities.They run the world.
- When adults understand,kids will be fine.
